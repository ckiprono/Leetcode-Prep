Sliding Window invloves dealing with subarrays of a larger array.
For instance, if we have an array [1,2,3,4,5], some of its subarrays include [1,2], [2,3]....we maintain the order.
The name window stems from 'subarray'. 
The template for dealing with sliding window problems is as follows

def fun(arr):
    n=len(arr)
    left=0
    for right in range(0,n-1):
        #Do some logic that adds arr[right] to the window

        while window is Invalid:
            #Do some logic to "remove" element at arr[left] from window
            left+=1
        #Do some logic to update the answer
